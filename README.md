# MicroServices with .Net Core

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

- Highly maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team

## Microservices Pros & Cons

Pros  | Cons
------------- | -------------
Designed for continous deployment  | Complexity of distributed system
Easy to understand code base  | Troubshooting hard across services
Faster builds  | No way to maintain transaction across services
Highly scalable  | Shared code to be moved to libraries
Isolation from failures  | 
Independent deployments & failures | 
Faster adoption of new tech | 

## when to use Microservices?

One word 'autonomous' teams. Start into microservices when

- Small team cannot handle a large code base
- Difficult to build & deploy huge codebase
- Long testing cycles and enhanced time to market
- Unable to adopt newer tech due to huge code base
